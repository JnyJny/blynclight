    """BlyncLight

    The Embrava BlyncLight family of USB connected products responds
    to a 9-byte command word. The command word enables activation or
    deactivation of various features; turning the light on and off,
    changing it's color, causing the light to flash, dimming or
    brightening, playing musical tunes stored in some BlyncLight
    model's firmware, muting or changing the volume of the playing
    music.

    Not all devices have musical capability and music related
    functionality has not yet been tested. 3 Apr 2019

    The recommended way to obtain a BlyncLight object is to use the
    class method get_light().

    >>> light = BlyncLight.get_light()

    Features of the light are controlled by assigning values to
    attributes of the BlyncLight object:

    >>> light.red = 0xff
    >>> light.on = 1
    >>> light.on = 0

    Usage Notes
    ===========

    The BlyncLight object is an in-memory representation of the
    state of the hardware device. I have not been able to discern how
    to read the device's current state, so every time a new object is
    instantiated it writes a known state to the device by default.

    Additionally, any updates to the bit fields in the ByncLight class
    will be immediately written to the hardware device by default.
    
    Finally, when a BlyncLight object is deallocated it will attempt
    to return the light to a known quiescent state before releasing
    the device. 

    Callers can defer hardware updates by setting the 'immediate'
    attribute to False. Any changes to command fields will not be
    written to the device. Setting 'immediate' to True will write the
    current state of the command word to the device. The BlyncLight
    object also provides a context manager method that can be used to
    defer updates:

    >>> with light.updates_paused():
    ...     light.red = 0
    ...     light.blue = 255
    ...     light.green = 0
    ...     light.on = True

    is equivalent to:

    >>> light.immediate = False
    >>> light.red = 0
    >>> light.blue = 255
    >>> light.green = 0
    >>> light.on = True
    >>> light.immediate = True

    is equivalent (almost) to:

    >>> light.color = (0, 255, 0)
    >>> light.on = True

    ===CAVEAT===

    Before turning the light on, make sure to specify a color
    otherwise the device will not emit any light. It can be
    very frustrating to turn the light on and not have any
    noticible effect.
