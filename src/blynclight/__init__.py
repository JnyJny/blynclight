"""bindings for Embrava BlyncLight devices.

This module provides python bindings for interacting with the Embrava
BlyncLight family of devices via Human Input Device Application
Programming Interface (HIDAPI). HIDAPI is a C language library that
provides access to USB devices.

You can control Embrava BlyncLight devices directly:

> from blynclight import BlyncLight
> b = BlyncLight.first_light()
> b.color = (0, 255, 0)                         # set color to blue
> b.on = True                                   # turn light on
> b.color = (255, 0, 0)                         # set color to red
> b.on = False                                  # turn light off

Or control the device via http API:

> from blynclight import BlyncLightProxy
> proxy = BlyncLightProxy('http://yourhost:port')
> available = proxy.status()
> proxy.on(0)
> proxy.red(0, 255)
> proxy.green(0, 0)
> proxy.blue(0, 255)
> proxy.color(0, (255,255,255))
> proxy.off(0)

The BlyncLightProxy method of control requires a HTTP server that
provides the expected REST interface. This is somewhat more involved
than talking to the light directly, but allows more flexibility.
